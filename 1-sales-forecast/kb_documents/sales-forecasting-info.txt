Step-by-Step Forecast Process for Retail Sales Time-Series Data using Python and Scikit-learn

1. Import necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Load and preprocess the data:
```python
# Load data from JSON file
df = pd.read_json('data.json', lines=True)

# Convert 'day' to datetime
df['day'] = pd.to_datetime(df['day'])

# Set 'day' as index
df.set_index('day', inplace=True)

# Sort by date
df.sort_index(inplace=True)

# Create lag features
for i in range(1, 8):
    df[f'lag_{i}'] = df['totalSales'].shift(i)

# Drop rows with NaN values
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

3. Prepare features and target:
```python
X = df[['lag_1', 'lag_2', 'lag_3', 'lag_4', 'lag_5', 'lag_6', 'lag_7']]
y = df['totalSales']

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

4. Train the Random Forest model:
```python
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

5. Make predictions:
```python
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
```

6. Evaluate the model:
```python
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}")
```

7. Visualize the results:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(y_test.index, y_test.values, label='Actual')
plt.plot(y_test.index, y_pred, label='Predicted')
plt.title('Random Forest Sales Forecast')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

8. Analyze feature importance:
```python
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X.columns,
    'importance': rf_model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print(feature_importance)
```

Understanding the forecasted sales values:
1. Compare the predicted values (y_pred) with the actual values (y_test) to assess the model's accuracy.
2. The RMSE provides a measure of the average prediction error. Lower RMSE indicates better model performance.
3. Visualize the actual vs. predicted values to identify any patterns or discrepancies in the sales forecast.

Factors driving the forecasted sales values:
1. Examine the feature importance output to understand which lag features have the most significant impact on the predictions.
2. The lag features with higher importance scores are the primary drivers of the forecast.
3. Consider external factors not included in the model (e.g., promotions, holidays, seasons) that might influence retail sales patterns.
4. Analyze the model's performance during different time periods or seasons to identify any temporal patterns affecting the forecast accuracy.

To improve the sales forecast:
1. Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) or ensemble methods.
2. Include additional features such as promotional data, day of the week, or holidays.
3. Try different time windows for lag features or rolling statistics.
4. Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
5. Consider using more advanced time series techniques like SARIMA or neural network-based models for complex seasonal retail patterns.
